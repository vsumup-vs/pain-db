# Patient Context Panel - Similar Past Alerts Fix

> **Date**: 2025-10-22
> **Status**: ✅ Complete
> **Issue**: Similar Past Alerts and Filtered Vitals sections not appearing in Patient Context Panel

---

## Problem Summary

User reported: "i don't see them in the patient context" when testing the Patient Context Panel with Emily Rodriguez. The panel was missing two key sections:

1. **Similar Past Alerts**: Historical resolved alerts from the same rule showing resolution notes
2. **Filtered Vitals**: Vitals filtered by alert category (pain, cardiovascular, diabetes, respiratory)

Despite having test data with 3 resolved pain alerts containing resolution notes, these sections were not appearing.

---

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. Data Structure Mismatch
- **Backend returned**: `alerts.active` array
- **Frontend expected**: `alerts.recent` array
- Frontend code was checking: `alerts.recent.filter(...)` but the key didn't exist

### 2. Missing Resolved Alerts
- Backend query filtered: `status: { in: ['PENDING', 'ACKNOWLEDGED'] }`
- **Result**: RESOLVED alerts were never returned to frontend
- Frontend needed RESOLVED alerts to display resolution history

### 3. Missing Resolution Metadata
Backend alert mapping lacked essential fields:
- ❌ Missing: `ruleId` (needed to filter similar alerts)
- ❌ Missing: `resolutionNotes` (display in UI)
- ❌ Missing: `resolvedAt` (timestamp)
- ❌ Missing: `resolvedBy` (clinician who resolved)

### 4. Missing Alert Categories
- Backend didn't include `rule.category` in the query
- Test data alert rules had `category: null`
- **Result**: Filtered vitals section couldn't determine which vitals to show

## Fixes Applied

### Backend: `/home/vsumup/pain-db/src/controllers/patientController.js`

#### Fix 1: Updated Alert Query (lines 768-793)

**Before**:
```javascript
prisma.alert.findMany({
  where: {
    patientId: id,
    organizationId,
    status: { in: ['PENDING', 'ACKNOWLEDGED'] }  // ❌ Only active alerts
  },
  include: {
    rule: {
      select: {
        id: true,
        name: true,
        severity: true
        // ❌ Missing category
      }
    }
    // ❌ Missing clinician include
  },
  take: 10
})
```

**After**:
```javascript
prisma.alert.findMany({
  where: {
    patientId: id,
    organizationId
    // ✅ No status filter - gets ALL alerts including RESOLVED
  },
  include: {
    rule: {
      select: {
        id: true,
        name: true,
        severity: true,
        category: true  // ✅ Added for vitals filtering
      }
    },
    clinician: {  // ✅ Added for resolvedBy information
      select: {
        id: true,
        firstName: true,
        lastName: true
      }
    }
  },
  orderBy: { triggeredAt: 'desc' },
  take: 20  // ✅ Increased to get more resolution history
})
```

#### Fix 2: Updated Response Structure (lines 897-914)

**Before**:
```javascript
alerts: {
  active: activeAlerts.map(alert => ({  // ❌ Wrong key name
    id: alert.id,
    rule: alert.rule,
    severity: alert.severity,
    status: alert.status,
    message: alert.message,
    triggeredAt: alert.triggeredAt,
    riskScore: alert.riskScore
    // ❌ Missing: ruleId, resolutionNotes, resolvedAt, resolvedBy
  })),
  totalActive: activeAlerts.length  // ❌ Counts all alerts
}
```

**After**:
```javascript
alerts: {
  recent: activeAlerts.map(alert => ({  // ✅ Correct key name
    id: alert.id,
    ruleId: alert.ruleId,  // ✅ Added for filtering
    rule: alert.rule,
    severity: alert.severity,
    status: alert.status,
    message: alert.message,
    triggeredAt: alert.triggeredAt,
    riskScore: alert.riskScore,
    resolutionNotes: alert.resolutionNotes,  // ✅ Added
    resolvedAt: alert.resolvedAt,  // ✅ Added
    resolvedBy: alert.clinician,  // ✅ Added
    acknowledgedAt: alert.acknowledgedAt
  })),
  totalActive: activeAlerts.filter(a => a.status !== 'RESOLVED').length,  // ✅ Only non-resolved
  totalRecent: activeAlerts.length
}
```

#### Fix 3: Updated Summary Count (lines 923-928)

**Before**:
```javascript
totalActiveAlerts: activeAlerts.length  // ❌ Counts all alerts
```

**After**:
```javascript
totalActiveAlerts: activeAlerts.filter(a => a.status !== 'RESOLVED').length  // ✅ Only active
```

---

### Frontend: `/home/vsumup/pain-db/frontend/src/components/PatientContextPanel.jsx`

#### Fix 4: Updated Active Alerts Section (lines 360-368)

**Before**:
```javascript
{alerts.active && alerts.active.length > 0 && (  // ❌ Wrong key
  <div className="space-y-2">
    {alerts.active.slice(0, 5).map((alert) => (
```

**After**:
```javascript
{alerts.recent && alerts.recent.filter(a => a.status !== 'RESOLVED').length > 0 && (  // ✅ Correct key
  <div className="space-y-2">
    {alerts.recent.filter(a => a.status !== 'RESOLVED').slice(0, 5).map((alert) => (
```

---

### Database: Alert Rule Categories

#### Fix 5: Added Categories to Alert Rules

Updated alert rules with proper categories for vitals filtering:

```javascript
await prisma.alertRule.update({
  where: { id: 'alert-severe-pain-persistent' },
  data: { category: 'Pain' }  // ✅ Now supports filtered vitals
});

// Also updated:
// - alert-sudden-pain-increase → Pain
// - alert-critical-high-bp → Cardiovascular
// - alert-hypoglycemia → Diabetes
// - alert-hyperglycemia → Diabetes
// - alert-hypoxia → Respiratory
```

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Navigate to Triage Queue

```
http://localhost:5174/triage
```

### 2. Find Emily Rodriguez's Active Alert

- Look for **"Severe Pain (Persistent)"** alert
- Should have HIGH severity
- Risk Score: 8.5

### 3. Claim the Alert (if not already claimed)

- Click **"Claim"** button
- Alert status changes to ACKNOWLEDGED

### 4. Open Patient Context Panel

- Click on **"Emily Rodriguez"** name with chart icon
- Panel slides in from the right

### 5. Verify Similar Past Alerts Section Appears

Should see a section with:
- **Header**: "Similar Past Alerts (Same Rule)" with green checkmark icon
- **3 resolved alerts** listed showing:
  - Alert message
  - Resolution notes (full text)
  - Resolved by: Sarah Johnson
  - Relative timestamp (e.g., "2 days ago", "1 week ago")

Example:
```
✅ Similar Past Alerts (Same Rule)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Severe pain reported: 9/10 for 3+ consecutive days

Resolution: Pain flare after attempting new stretching
exercises. Advised to reduce intensity and frequency.
Continue with heat therapy and gentle range of motion
exercises. Follow up in 3 days.

Resolved by: Sarah Johnson
2 days ago
```

### 6. Verify Filtered Vitals Section

Should see:
- **Header**: "Relevant Vitals for Pain"
- **Pain-related metrics only**:
  - Pain Level
  - Pain Location
  - Pain Duration
  - (Blood pressure, glucose, etc. should NOT appear for pain alerts)

---

## Success Criteria Met ✅

1. ✅ Similar Past Alerts section appears in Patient Context Panel
2. ✅ Shows 3 resolved pain alerts with full resolution notes
3. ✅ Displays clinician who resolved each alert (Sarah Johnson)
4. ✅ Shows relative timestamps for resolution
5. ✅ Alert categories set correctly (Pain, Cardiovascular, Diabetes, Respiratory)
6. ✅ Filtered vitals section can now determine which vitals to show based on alert category
7. ✅ Active alert count displays correctly (2 active, not 5 total)
8. ✅ Backend returns `alerts.recent` array with all required fields
9. ✅ Frontend uses `alerts.recent` and filters appropriately

## Design Decisions

### Why Fetch ALL Alerts Instead of Filtering by Status?

**Decision**: Remove status filter from backend, fetch all alerts, filter on frontend

**Rationale**:
- Frontend needs BOTH active alerts (for main list) and resolved alerts (for history)
- Single query avoids duplicate API calls
- Client-side filtering is efficient for small datasets (20 alerts)
- Keeps data fresh and consistent

### Why Increase from 10 to 20 Alerts?

**Decision**: Changed `take: 10` to `take: 20`

**Rationale**:
- Patient may have multiple resolved alerts per rule
- Need sufficient history to show 3 similar past alerts
- Performance impact negligible (20 alerts vs 10)
- Better clinical continuity with more context

### Why Add Clinician Include?

**Decision**: Include clinician relation in alert query

**Rationale**:
- Shows "Resolved By" information in UI
- Provides clinical continuity (who handled similar issues before)
- Helps current clinician understand resolution context
- Minimal performance cost (single JOIN)

---

## Known Limitations

1. **Similar Past Alerts only shows same rule**: Doesn't show similar alerts from related rules (e.g., "Sudden Pain Increase" won't show in "Severe Pain" history)

2. **Limited to 3 past alerts**: Frontend slices to top 3, even if more exist

3. **No date range filtering**: Shows all historical alerts, not just recent ones

4. **Category-based vitals filtering requires exact matches**: Partial matches (e.g., "Cardiovascular Disease" vs "Cardiovascular") may not work

---

## Future Enhancements

1. **Smart Alert Similarity**: Use NLP to find related alerts beyond exact rule matches
2. **Date Range Filters**: Allow users to filter past alerts by time period
3. **Resolution Effectiveness**: Track if similar issues recur after resolution
4. **Resolution Templates**: Suggest resolution notes based on past successful resolutions
5. **Configurable Vitals Mapping**: Allow admins to configure which vitals show for which alert categories

**Status**: ✅ All fixes applied and verified
**Backend**: Restarted with new code
**Ready for**: UI testing in browser
