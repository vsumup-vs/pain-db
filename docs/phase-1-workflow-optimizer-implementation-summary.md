# Phase 1 Workflow Optimizer - Implementation Summary

> **Document Purpose**: Executive summary of Phase 1 workflow optimizer features with links to detailed specifications
> **Last Updated**: 2025-10-14
> **Status**: Ready for Implementation

---

## Overview

Phase 1 has been restructured to integrate RPM Workflow Optimizer concepts, transforming ClinMetrics Pro from a "monitoring platform" into a complete "workflow optimizer" that drives operational efficiency for care managers, physicians, and RPM coordinators.

**Strategic Goal**: Deliver a pilot-ready platform in 8-10 weeks that combines:
- **Clinical Standards** (ClinMetrics Pro's strength): NIH PROMIS, validated instruments, ICD-10/SNOMED coding
- **Operational Efficiency** (RPM Workflow Optimizer's strength): Triage queues, task management, smart documentation, billing readiness

**Market Positioning**: "The only RPM platform combining clinical standards with workflow optimization"

---

## Phase 1 Structure

### Phase 1a: Workflow Optimizer Features (6 weeks)
Operational efficiency tools that drive 40-50% reduction in alert resolution time and 50% reduction in documentation time.

### Phase 1b: Clinical Stabilization & Polish (2-3 weeks)
Authentication testing, notifications, real-time updates, analytics dashboards.

**Total Timeline**: 8-9 weeks to pilot-ready platform

**Estimated Effort**: 8-10 days

**Location**: `/home/vsumup/pain-db/.agent-os/specs/2025-10-14-prioritized-triage-queue/`

**What It Does**:
- Calculates 0-10 risk score for each alert based on vitals deviation, trend velocity, adherence, and severity
- Sorts alerts by priority (highest risk first)
- Color-codes alerts: üî¥ Critical (8-10), üü† High (6-8), üü° Medium (4-6), üü¢ Low (0-4)
- Displays SLA breach warnings (üü° approaching, üî¥ exceeded)
- Allows care managers to "claim" alerts to prevent duplicate work

**Success Metric**: Median alert resolution time <20 minutes (vs current ~30 min baseline = 40% reduction)

**Risk Scoring Algorithm**:
```
riskScore = (vitalsDeviation * 0.5 + trendVelocity * 0.3 + adherencePenalty * 0.2) * alertSeverityMultiplier
```

---

### Phase 1 Total Timeline: 8-9 Weeks to Pilot-Ready Platform

**Resourcing**: 2-person team (1 Full-Stack Engineer + 1 PM/Designer)

**Parallel Work Opportunities**:
- PM/Designer: UX research, wireframes, clinical workflows (Weeks 1-3)
- Engineer: Backend data models and APIs (Weeks 1-6)
- PM/Designer: Frontend UI implementation support (Weeks 4-9)
- Engineer: Alert evaluation engine (can run parallel to workflow features, Weeks 1-6 if second engineer available)

---

## Dependencies

### Phase 1a (Workflow Optimizer)
- ‚úÖ Product analytics instrumentation (track time-to-resolve, alerts/user/day, documentation time)
- ‚úÖ UX research with pilot clinic care managers (validate triage queue design, task workflows)
- ‚úÖ Risk scoring algorithm validation (clinical advisor review of thresholds and weights)

### Phase 1b (Stabilization)
- ‚úÖ Complete authentication testing on feature/auth-testing branch
- ‚úÖ Finalize condition preset library with validated clinical standards
- ‚úÖ Establish initial alert rule library based on clinical evidence
- ‚úÖ Pilot clinic identified and onboarding plan finalized

---

## Risks & Mitigation

### Risk 1: Scope Creep
**Problem**: Adding 5 major features to Phase 1 increases scope by 50%

**Mitigation**:
- Use RPM Workflow Optimizer spec as MVP definition - only P0 features
- Defer "nice-to-have" features (saved views, daily wrap-up) to Phase 2
- Parallel work: PM/Designer on UX while engineer completes auth testing

**Impact**: Extends Phase 1 from 4 weeks to 8-9 weeks, but delivers pilot-ready product

---

### Risk 2: User Adoption if Workflow UX is Poor
**Problem**: Workflow features require excellent UX to drive efficiency gains

**Mitigation**:
- Invest in UX research with pilot clinic care managers (Week 1-2)
- Conduct usability testing on wireframes before implementation
- Iterative design: ship v1, measure time-per-alert, refine based on data

**Success Criteria**: Time-per-alert <20 minutes (vs RPM Workflow Optimizer's <30 min target)

---

### Risk 3: Clinical Monitoring Engine Still Missing
**Problem**: Even with workflow features, cannot automatically trigger alerts based on observations

**Strategic Decision**: Build workflow features first (Phase 1a), then alert evaluation engine (Phase 1b - can run parallel)
- **Pro**: Workflow UX enables manual alert triage immediately
- **Con**: Still requires manual alert creation for 6-8 weeks
- **Recommendation**: Build alert evaluation engine in parallel with workflow features if second engineer available

---
