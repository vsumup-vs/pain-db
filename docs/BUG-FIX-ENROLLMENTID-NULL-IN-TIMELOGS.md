# Bug Fix: enrollmentId NULL in TimeLogs

> **Date**: 2025-10-19
> **Status**: ✅ FIXED
> **Priority**: P0 - Critical (blocks accurate billing)

## Problem Statement

When using the timer auto-start/stop functionality to resolve alerts, the created TimeLog records had `enrollmentId: null`, preventing accurate billing calculations.

**Impact**: Without `enrollmentId` linkage, the billing readiness service cannot determine which observations and time logs belong to specific billing programs.

## Investigation Summary

### Discovery 1: Missing Billing Program Assignment

**Script**: `scripts/check-john-smith-enrollments.js`

**Finding**: John Smith's enrollment had `billingProgramId: NULL` - no billing program assigned.

**Evidence**:
```
Enrollment 1:
  ID: cmgx5a4x800077k0u3bzpdx5j
  Status: ACTIVE
  Care Program: Remote Patient Monitoring - Diabetes
  Billing Program: NONE  ← Problem!
  billingProgramId: NULL ← Problem!
```

**Fix Applied**: Created and ran `scripts/assign-billing-to-john-smith.js` to assign billing program `cmguqf8ih00007k665e4csbh1` (CMS Remote Patient Monitoring 2025) to the enrollment.

**Result**: Enrollment now has a billing program assigned.

---

### Discovery 2: Organization Mismatch (Root Cause)

**Script**: `scripts/check-timelog.js`

**Finding**: After assigning the billing program, TimeLogs still had `enrollmentId: null`.

**Evidence**:
```
=== TimeLog Details ===
ID: cmgxukmhn000z7km40oiczln1
Patient: John Smith
Clinician: SSE TestUser (sse-test@example.com)
Duration: 1 minutes
enrollmentId: null  ← Still null!
❌ NOT LINKED to enrollment
```

**Root Cause Discovered**:
- **John Smith** (patient) is in organization: `cmgx3ot3900007k3acrrcaizl`
- **SSE TestUser** (clinician) is in organization: `cmgv3qs7m00007knezlq1suon` ("Test Clinic for enrollmentId")
- **Different organizations!**

**Problem in Code**: `alertController.js` line 607 (before fix):
```javascript
// ❌ WRONG: Uses clinician's organizationId
const enrollmentId = await findBillingEnrollment(alert.patientId, organizationId, tx);
```

Where `organizationId` came from the clinician's request context (line 425):
```javascript
const organizationId = req.organizationId || req.user?.currentOrganization;
```

**Why This Fails**:
The `findBillingEnrollment` helper searches for an enrollment where:
```javascript
{
  patientId: alert.patientId,
  organizationId: organizationId,  // Clinician's org
  billingProgramId: { not: null },
  status: 'ACTIVE'
}
```

Since John Smith's enrollment is in **his** organization (`cmgx3ot3900007k3acrrcaizl`), not the **clinician's** organization (`cmgv3qs7m00007knezlq1suon`), the query returns no results, so `enrollmentId` is set to `null`.

## Fixes Applied

### Fix 1: Alert Controller (`src/controllers/alertController.js`)

**Changed Line 607** (now line 609):

**Before**:
```javascript
const enrollmentId = await findBillingEnrollment(alert.patientId, organizationId, tx);
```

**After**:
```javascript
// IMPORTANT: Use patient's organizationId, not clinician's organizationId
// This ensures we find the correct enrollment even when clinician and patient are in different orgs
const enrollmentId = await findBillingEnrollment(alert.patientId, alert.patient.organizationId, tx);
```

**Why This Works**:
- The alert query at line 510 includes `patient: true`, giving us access to `alert.patient.organizationId`
- Now we search for enrollments in the **patient's** organization, which is where the enrollment actually exists
- This handles cross-organization scenarios where a clinician from one organization manages patients in another organization

---

### Fix 2: Observation Controller (`src/controllers/observationController.js`)

**Changed Line 37**:

**Before**:
```javascript
prisma.patient.findUnique({
  where: { id: patientId },
  select: { id: true, medicalRecordNumber: true } // Only select needed fields
}),
```

**After**:
```javascript
prisma.patient.findUnique({
  where: { id: patientId },
  select: { id: true, medicalRecordNumber: true, organizationId: true } // Include organizationId for billing enrollment lookup
}),
```

**Changed Line 118** (now line 121):

**Before**:
```javascript
// Auto-detect billing enrollment if not provided
let finalEnrollmentId = enrollmentId;
if (!finalEnrollmentId && organizationId) {
  finalEnrollmentId = await findBillingEnrollment(patientId, organizationId);
}
```

**After**:
```javascript
// Auto-detect billing enrollment if not provided
// IMPORTANT: Use patient's organizationId for finding billing enrollment,
// not the clinician's organizationId from the request context.
// This handles cross-organization scenarios where a clinician manages patients in different orgs.
let finalEnrollmentId = enrollmentId;
if (!finalEnrollmentId && patient.organizationId) {
  finalEnrollmentId = await findBillingEnrollment(patientId, patient.organizationId);
}
```

**Why This Works**:
- Patient's `organizationId` is now fetched in the initial query
- Uses the patient's organization to find the enrollment, not the clinician's organization
- Ensures observations are correctly linked to billing enrollments even when created by cross-organization clinicians

---

### Fix 3: Time Tracking Controller (`src/controllers/timeTrackingController.js`)

**Changed Lines 80-105**:

**Before**:
```javascript
const { patientId, cptCode, notes, billable } = req.body;
const userId = req.user.id;
const organizationId = req.user.currentOrganization;

try {
  // Find clinician ID from authenticated user
  const clinician = await prisma.clinician.findFirst({
    where: {
      email: req.user.email,
      organizationId
    },
    select: { id: true }
  });

  const clinicianId = clinician?.id || null;

  const result = await timeTrackingService.stopTimer({
    userId,
    patientId,
    clinicianId,
    organizationId,
    cptCode,
    notes,
    billable: billable !== false
  });
```

**After**:
```javascript
const { patientId, cptCode, notes, billable } = req.body;
const userId = req.user.id;
const clinicianOrganizationId = req.user.currentOrganization;

try {
  // Fetch patient to get their organizationId for billing enrollment lookup
  // IMPORTANT: Use patient's organizationId, not clinician's organizationId
  // This handles cross-organization scenarios where a clinician manages patients in different orgs.
  const patient = await prisma.patient.findUnique({
    where: { id: patientId },
    select: { id: true, organizationId: true }
  });

  if (!patient) {
    return res.status(404).json({
      success: false,
      message: 'Patient not found'
    });
  }

  // Find clinician ID from authenticated user
  const clinician = await prisma.clinician.findFirst({
    where: {
      email: req.user.email,
      organizationId: clinicianOrganizationId
    },
    select: { id: true }
  });

  const clinicianId = clinician?.id || null;

  const result = await timeTrackingService.stopTimer({
    userId,
    patientId,
    clinicianId,
    organizationId: patient.organizationId, // Use patient's org for billing enrollment
    cptCode,
    notes,
    billable: billable !== false
  });
```

**Why This Works**:
- Fetches patient to get their `organizationId` before calling the service
- Passes patient's `organizationId` to the service layer for billing enrollment lookup
- Ensures timer-based TimeLogs are correctly linked to billing enrollments even when clinician is in different organization

## Verification Steps

### 1. Verify All Fixes Are in Place

**Alert Controller**:
```bash
grep -n "alert.patient.organizationId" src/controllers/alertController.js
```
Expected: Line 609 should show the updated code.

**Observation Controller**:
```bash
grep -n "patient.organizationId" src/controllers/observationController.js
```
Expected: Line 37 includes `organizationId` in patient select, Line 121 uses `patient.organizationId` in findBillingEnrollment call.

**Time Tracking Controller**:
```bash
grep -n "patient.organizationId" src/controllers/timeTrackingController.js
```
Expected: Lines 88-90 fetch patient with organizationId, Line 120 uses `patient.organizationId` when calling service.

### 2. Test with New Alert Resolution

1. Navigate to the Triage Queue in the browser
2. Create a new alert for John Smith
3. Start the timer
4. Stop the timer and resolve the alert
5. Check the created TimeLog:

```bash
node scripts/check-timelog.js
```

Expected output:
```
=== Billing Enrollment Linkage ===
enrollmentId: cmgx5a4x800077k0u3bzpdx5j
✅ LINKED to billing enrollment!
Billing Program: CMS Remote Patient Monitoring 2025
Program Code: CMS_RPM_2025
```

### 3. Verify Billing Readiness Calculation

After creating new TimeLogs with proper `enrollmentId` linkage, verify billing calculations work:

```javascript
const { billingReadinessService } = require('./src/services/billingReadinessService');
const result = await billingReadinessService.calculateBillingReadiness(
  'cmgx5a4x800077k0u3bzpdx5j',  // John Smith's enrollment ID
  '2025-10'  // October 2025
);
console.log(result);
```

Expected: Time logs should now be correctly counted toward billing eligibility.

## Key Learnings

1. **Multi-Tenant Architecture Complexity**: When clinicians and patients can be in different organizations, always use the **patient's organizationId** for patient-related queries, not the clinician's.

2. **Billing Program Assignment**: Enrollments must have `billingProgramId` assigned for billing calculations to work.

3. **Cross-Organization Access**: The alert system allows clinicians to manage patients across organizations, but billing calculations must respect the patient's organizational context.

## Next Steps

1. **Test the fix** with real alert resolution workflow
2. **Update seed data** to ensure test patients have billing programs assigned from the start
3. **Consider adding validation** to prevent enrollments without billing programs when the care program type is RPM/RTM/CCM
