**Conclusion**: ClinMetrics Pro has the **data foundation** but lacks the **workflow orchestration** layer that drives care manager efficiency.

---

### 🔴 Missing Concepts (What We Don't Have)

| RPM Workflow Optimizer Feature | Why It's Missing in ClinMetrics Pro | Impact | Recommendation |
|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------|--------|----------------|
| **Risk Scoring Algorithm** | No algorithm combining vital deviation, trend velocity, adherence into a single risk score | Care managers can't prioritize patients objectively | **Implement in Phase 1** - Simple algorithm: `risk = (vitals_deviation * 0.5) + (trend_velocity * 0.3) + (adherence_penalty * 0.2)` |
| **SLA Timers & Escalation** | Alerts lack time-to-acknowledge and time-to-resolve SLAs | No accountability for missed alerts | **Add in Phase 1** - Alert model needs `acknowledgedAt`, `resolvedAt`, SLA breach tracking |
| **Saved Views & Filters** | No ability to save custom patient lists (e.g., "AM Hypertension Round") | Care managers rebuild filters daily | **Add in Phase 2** - User preferences model for saved filters |
| **Bulk Actions** | No multi-select actions (resolve/snooze multiple alerts) | Inefficient for high alert volumes | **Add in Phase 1** - Frontend checkbox selection + batch API endpoints |
| **Daily Wrap-Up Report** | No end-of-day summary (alerts handled, resolution times, follow-ups) | Care managers lack visibility into productivity | **Add in Phase 2** - Reporting service with daily digest email |
| **Monthly Billing Readiness Dashboard** | No compliance status view (minutes accrued per patient) | Coordinators manually calculate billing eligibility | **Add in Phase 1** - Critical for pilot success |
| **Device Silence Detection** | No auto-generation of adherence tasks when readings stop | Missing readings go unnoticed until manual review | **Add in Phase 2** - Scheduled job to detect >48hr gaps |
| **Threshold Override Workflow** | AlertRule model supports org-level customization, but no patient-specific overrides | Care managers can't personalize thresholds for stable patients | **Add in Phase 2** - PatientAlertRuleOverride junction table |
| **Physician Attestation Workflow** | No sign-off/approval process for encounter notes | Billing documentation lacks physician attestation | **Add in Phase 1** - Note model needs `attestedBy`, `attestedAt`, locked status |

**Conclusion**: RPM Workflow Optimizer focuses on **operational details** that ClinMetrics Pro deferred to later phases. These are **essential for pilot clinic success**.

## Strategic Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Phase 1 - Next 4 Weeks)

**Goal**: Transform ClinMetrics Pro from "monitoring platform" to "workflow optimizer" by adding operational efficiency features.

#### 1. **Implement Prioritized Triage Queue** (8-10 days) 🚨 **CRITICAL**

**Why**: Care managers need a single, prioritized view of patients requiring attention. Current dashboard shows alerts, but no risk scoring or priority sorting.

**Implementation**:
```javascript
// Add risk scoring algorithm
const calculatePatientRisk = async (patientId) => {
  // 1. Vital deviation score (0-10): How far from normal ranges?
  const vitalScore = getRecentVitalsDeviation(patientId); // e.g., BP 180/110 = high score

  // 2. Trend velocity score (0-10): Worsening trends?
  const trendScore = analyzeTrendVelocity(patientId); // e.g., 3 consecutive high readings

  // 3. Adherence penalty (-5 to 0): Missing readings or assessments?
  const adherencePenalty = getAdherencePenalty(patientId); // e.g., no readings in 48hr = -5

  // 4. Alert severity multiplier (1.0 - 2.0)
  const alertMultiplier = getActiveAlertSeverity(patientId); // CRITICAL alerts = 2.0x

  const rawScore = (vitalScore * 0.5 + trendScore * 0.3 + adherencePenalty * 0.2) * alertMultiplier;
  return Math.max(0, Math.min(10, rawScore)); // Clamp to 0-10
};

// Update Alert model schema
model Alert {
  // ... existing fields ...
  riskScore       Float?   // 0-10 risk score
  priorityRank    Int?     // Global rank across all alerts
  slaBreachTime   DateTime? // When SLA will be breached
}
```

**Frontend Changes**:
- Update `Dashboard.jsx` to show triage queue with risk-based sorting
- Color-coded risk levels: 🔴 Critical (8-10), 🟠 High (6-8), 🟡 Medium (4-6), 🟢 Low (0-4)
- "Claim" button to assign alert to current user (prevent collisions)

**Effort**: 8-10 days (backend risk algorithm + frontend queue UI)

---

#### 2. **Add Task Management System** (6-8 days) 🚨 **CRITICAL**

**Why**: Care managers need to track follow-up actions beyond just resolving alerts (e.g., "Call patient tomorrow," "Schedule med review in 1 week").

**Implementation**:
```prisma
// Add Task model to schema
model Task {
  id                String    @id @default(cuid())
  organizationId    String
  patientId         String
  assignedToId      String?   // Clinician assigned
  createdById       String

  dueDate           DateTime?
  priority          Priority  // LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH, URGENT
  status            TaskStatus // PENDING, IN_PROGRESS, COMPLETED, CANCELLED
  completedAt       DateTime?
  completedById     String?
  linkedAlertId     String?   // Optional link to triggering alert
  linkedAssessmentId String?

  MED_REVIEW
  ADHERENCE_CHECK
  LAB_ORDER
  REFERRAL
  CUSTOM
}

enum TaskStatus {
  PENDING
  IN_PROGRESS
  COMPLETED
  CANCELLED
}
```

**Frontend Changes**:
- New `Tasks.jsx` page with filters (assigned to me, due today, overdue)
- Add "Create Task" button in Patient Context Panel
- Bulk actions: assign/reassign, mark complete, change due date

**Effort**: 6-8 days (data model + CRUD + UI)

---

#### 3. **Build Patient Context Panel** (5-6 days) 🚨 **CRITICAL**

**Why**: When resolving an alert, care managers need complete patient context in one view (vitals trends, meds, problems, recent notes, contact info, device status).

**Implementation**:
- Create `PatientContextPanel.jsx` component (right-side drawer or modal)
- Fetch consolidated patient data:
  - Recent observations (7/30/90 day trends)
  - Active medications with adherence %
  - Condition presets and ICD-10 diagnoses
  - Recent assessments and scores
  - Contact info (phone, email, preferred contact time)
  - Device status (last transmission timestamp)
  - Recent notes/encounters

**Frontend Changes**:
- Trigger panel from alert row click or patient detail page
- Use TanStack React Query for efficient data fetching and caching
- Inline trend charts (lightweight line charts for vitals)

**Effort**: 5-6 days (backend endpoint for consolidated data + frontend panel UI)

---

#### 4. **Implement Smart Documentation Templates** (4-5 days) **HIGH PRIORITY**

**Why**: Care managers spend excessive time documenting encounters. Auto-populated notes from vitals, alert context, and call outcomes reduce documentation burden by 50%.

**Implementation**:
```prisma
// Add EncounterNote model
model EncounterNote {
  id                  String    @id @default(cuid())
  organizationId      String
  patientId           String

  CCM    // Chronic Care Management (CPT 99490, 99491)
  TCM    // Transitional Care Management (CPT 99495, 99496)
  GENERAL
}
```

**Note Template Example**:
```javascript
// Auto-populated RPM note template
const generateRPMNote = async (patientId, alertId) => {
  const patient = await getPatient(patientId);
  const alert = await getAlert(alertId);
  const vitals = await getRecentVitals(patientId, 7); // Last 7 days

  return {
    chiefConcern: `Alert triggered: ${alert.description}`,
    vitalsSnapshot: {
      bloodPressure: vitals.filter(v => v.metricKey === 'blood_pressure'),
      weight: vitals.filter(v => v.metricKey === 'weight'),
      // ... other relevant vitals
    },
    assessmentSummary: `Patient enrolled in ${patient.program} monitoring. Recent vitals show ${getTrendSummary(vitals)}.`,

    // Pre-filled template for clinician to edit
    subjectiveNotes: "[Patient reports...]",
    objectiveNotes: `BP: ${vitals[0].value} mmHg, Weight: ${vitals[1].value} lbs`,
    assessment: "[Clinical assessment based on vitals and patient report]",
    plan: "[Care plan and follow-up actions]"
  };
};
```

**Frontend Changes**:
- Add "Document Encounter" button in Patient Context Panel
- Smart template selection based on alert type or program
- Inline editing with autosave drafts
- "Finalize & Lock" button for attestation workflow

**Effort**: 4-5 days (note model + template generation logic + UI)

---

#### 5. **Add Monthly Billing Readiness Dashboard** (3-4 days) **HIGH PRIORITY**

**Why**: RPM coordinators need visibility into which patients meet billing requirements (e.g., 20+ minutes for CCM, 16+ days of readings for RPM).

**Implementation**:
```javascript
// Billing readiness calculation
const calculateBillingReadiness = async (organizationId, month, year) => {
  const patients = await prisma.patient.findMany({
    where: {
      enrollments: {
        some: {
          organizationId,
          status: 'ACTIVE',
          programType: { in: ['RPM', 'RTM', 'CCM'] }
        }
      }
    },
    include: {
      enrollments: true,
      timeLogs: {
        where: {
          // Filter by month/year
          loggedAt: {
            gte: new Date(year, month - 1, 1),
            lt: new Date(year, month, 1)
          }
        }
      },
      observations: {
        where: {
          recordedAt: {
            gte: new Date(year, month - 1, 1),
            lt: new Date(year, month, 1)
          }
        }
      }
    }
  });

  return patients.map(patient => {
    const enrollment = patient.enrollments[0];
    const totalMinutes = patient.timeLogs.reduce((sum, log) => sum + log.durationMinutes, 0);
    const readingDays = countUniqueDays(patient.observations);

    // Determine billing eligibility
    let billingStatus = 'NOT_ELIGIBLE';
    let reason = '';

    if (enrollment.programType === 'CCM' && totalMinutes >= 20) {
      billingStatus = 'ELIGIBLE';
    } else if (enrollment.programType === 'RPM' && readingDays >= 16) {
      billingStatus = 'ELIGIBLE';
    } else if (enrollment.programType === 'RTM' && totalMinutes >= 20 && readingDays >= 16) {
      billingStatus = 'ELIGIBLE';
    } else {
      reason = `Need ${20 - totalMinutes} more minutes or ${16 - readingDays} more reading days`;
    }

    return {
      patientId: patient.id,
      patientName: `${patient.firstName} ${patient.lastName}`,
      programType: enrollment.programType,
      totalMinutes,
      readingDays,
      billingStatus,
      reason
    };
  });
};
```

**Frontend Changes**:
- New `BillingReadiness.jsx` page with month/year selector
- Table showing patients with eligibility status (🟢 Eligible, 🟡 Close, 🔴 Not Eligible)
- Export CSV for finance team
- Drill-down to patient details showing time logs and reading adherence

**Effort**: 3-4 days (backend calculation + frontend dashboard)

---

### Phase 1 Total Effort: **26-33 days** (5-6.5 weeks)

**Note**: With 2-person team (1 full-stack engineer + 1 PM/designer), this is realistic for a 6-8 week sprint with parallel work on design + backend.

---

| **Multi-Tenant SaaS** | ✅ **STRONG** - Implemented with org isolation, RBAC, audit logs | ✅ **PLANNED** - Org & clinic hierarchies | **Competitive Advantage**: ClinMetrics Pro ahead here |

**Conclusion**: ClinMetrics Pro has **stronger clinical foundations** (standards, multi-tenant, RBAC), but RPM Workflow Optimizer has **better operational workflows** (triage, tasks, documentation).

**Strategic Synthesis**: **Combine the best of both** - ClinMetrics Pro's standards-based library + RPM Workflow Optimizer's workflow efficiency = **market-leading solution**.

---

## What ClinMetrics Pro Does BETTER

| Differentiator | Why It's Better | Competitive Implication |
|----------------|-----------------|------------------------|
| **Standards-Based Clinical Library** | ClinMetrics Pro explicitly links metrics, templates, and presets to authoritative sources (NIH PROMIS, validated instruments). RPM Workflow Optimizer focuses on data normalization but lacks standards traceability. | **Healthcare orgs trust validated instruments** - ClinMetrics Pro can publish outcomes in peer-reviewed journals, RPM Workflow Optimizer cannot. |
| **Multi-Tenant Architecture** | Already implemented with organization-level isolation, RBAC, audit logging. RPM Workflow Optimizer plans this but hasn't built it. | **Time-to-market advantage** - ClinMetrics Pro can onboard multiple clinics NOW, RPM Workflow Optimizer needs 2-4 weeks to build multi-tenancy. |
| **Extensibility with Standards Integrity** | Clone-on-customize pattern allows org-specific modifications while maintaining traceability to source standards. | **Research-ready** - ClinMetrics Pro supports clinical trials and outcome studies, RPM Workflow Optimizer is operations-only. |
| **Comprehensive Data Model** | AssessmentTemplate, ConditionPreset, MetricDefinition, AlertRule models with deep relationships. | **Scalable to complex programs** - Can model intricate clinical protocols, not just device readings. |

**Implication**: ClinMetrics Pro is positioned for **academic medical centers and research institutions**, while RPM Workflow Optimizer targets **community clinics focused on efficiency**.

---

## What RPM Workflow Optimizer Does BETTER

| Differentiator | Why It's Better | Strategic Implication |
|----------------|-----------------|------------------------|
| **Prioritized Triage Queue** | Single, risk-scored view of all patients requiring attention. ClinMetrics Pro has alerts, but no priority sorting. | **Care manager efficiency** - RPM Workflow Optimizer users resolve alerts 40% faster (per spec). ClinMetrics Pro users waste time manually prioritizing. |
| **Task Management** | Explicit Task model with assignments, due dates, bulk actions. ClinMetrics Pro only has alerts. | **Workflow completeness** - RPM Workflow Optimizer tracks follow-up actions, ClinMetrics Pro loses track after alert resolution. |
| **Smart Documentation** | Auto-populated encounter notes from vitals and call outcomes. ClinMetrics Pro has assessment templates, but no encounter documentation. | **50% reduction in documentation time** (per spec) - Critical for clinician adoption. ClinMetrics Pro lacks this efficiency gain. |
| **Auto-Start/Stop Timers** | Timers automatically start when engaging with patient, stop on disposition. ClinMetrics Pro has TimeLog model, but manual entry only. | **Accurate billing documentation** - RPM Workflow Optimizer captures all billable time, ClinMetrics Pro relies on clinician memory. |
| **Billing Package Export** | Monthly roll-up by patient/provider with CPT-aligned summaries. ClinMetrics Pro has raw TimeLog data, but no export. | **Finance team efficiency** - RPM Workflow Optimizer ready for billing in 1 click, ClinMetrics Pro requires manual spreadsheet wrangling. |
| **SLA Timers & Escalation** | Alerts have time-to-acknowledge and time-to-resolve SLAs with escalation logic. ClinMetrics Pro has alert status, but no SLAs. | **Accountability** - RPM Workflow Optimizer prevents missed alerts, ClinMetrics Pro has no guardrails. |

**Implication**: RPM Workflow Optimizer is **operationally superior** for day-to-day care manager workflows. ClinMetrics Pro must adopt these features to compete.

---

## User Experience Comparison

### RPM Workflow Optimizer User Flow (Care Manager)
1. **Log in** → Land on triage dashboard with risk-sorted alerts
2. **Claim alert** → Timer auto-starts, patient context panel opens
3. **Call patient** → Document in smart template (pre-filled vitals)
4. **Resolve alert** → Timer auto-stops, minutes logged, task created if needed
5. **End of day** → Review daily summary (alerts handled, follow-ups tomorrow)

**Time per Alert**: **10-15 minutes** (per spec: 40% reduction from 30 min baseline)

---

### ClinMetrics Pro User Flow (Care Manager) - CURRENT STATE
1. **Log in** → Land on dashboard with alert list (no priority sorting)
2. **Open alert** → No patient context, navigate to separate patient detail page
3. **Review vitals** → Check Observations page for recent readings
4. **Call patient** → Return to alert, manually create TimeLog entry
5. **Document call** → No encounter note system, maybe create Assessment?
6. **Resolve alert** → Mark as Resolved
7. **Remember follow-up** → Hope to remember tomorrow (no task system)

**Time per Alert**: **20-30 minutes** (rough estimate - no automation)

**Conclusion**: ClinMetrics Pro workflow is **50-100% slower** due to manual steps and context switching.

## Technical Architecture Comparison

| Component | ClinMetrics Pro | RPM Workflow Optimizer | Assessment |
|-----------|----------------|------------------------|------------|
| **Backend** | Node.js + Express + Prisma ORM | Not specified (likely similar) | **Parity** |
| **Frontend** | React + Vite + TanStack React Query | Not specified (likely similar) | **Parity** |
| **Database** | PostgreSQL with multi-tenant schema | Not specified (likely PostgreSQL) | **Parity** |
| **Real-Time Updates** | ❌ Missing - no WebSocket/SSE | ✅ Planned - real-time triage updates | **Gap** - ClinMetrics Pro needs real-time |
| **Caching** | React Query caching only | Implies backend caching for performance | **Gap** - ClinMetrics Pro should add Redis for high-traffic endpoints |
| **Background Jobs** | node-cron scheduler (daily reminders only) | Event-driven processing for alert evaluation | **Gap** - ClinMetrics Pro needs alert evaluation service |
| **Audit Logging** | ✅ Comprehensive AuditLog model | ✅ Immutable audit trail | **Parity** |
| **API Design** | RESTful with planned FHIR R4 | RESTful with "standards-based data exchange" | **Parity** |

**Conclusion**: Architectures are similar. ClinMetrics Pro needs to add **real-time updates** and **background alert evaluation** to match RPM Workflow Optimizer's responsiveness.

---

## Business Metrics Comparison

| Success Metric | RPM Workflow Optimizer Target | ClinMetrics Pro Status | Gap Analysis |
|----------------|------------------------------|------------------------|--------------|
| **Alerts Resolved per Care Manager** | +50% within 60 days | No baseline - not tracking | **Must instrument** - Add daily active user (DAU) tracking and alerts/user/day metric |
| **Median Alert Resolution Time** | <30 minutes | Unknown - no timing data | **Must instrument** - Add `acknowledgedAt`, `resolvedAt` to Alert model |
| **Patient-to-Care-Manager Ratio** | Double from 150:1 to 300:1 | Not measured | **Can calculate** - Count active enrollments per clinician |
| **Documentation Time** | -50% via automation | Not measured | **Must instrument** - Track time from alert open to note saved |
| **Monthly Billing Readiness** | >95% by month 3 | Not measured | **Dashboard needed** - Build billing readiness report (Phase 1 recommendation) |
| **Uptime** | ≥99.9% | Unknown - no monitoring | **Must add** - Datadog/New Relic APM (Phase 2) |
| **API Response Time** | Median ≤200ms, 95th ≤500ms | Unknown - no monitoring | **Must add** - APM performance tracking |

**Conclusion**: RPM Workflow Optimizer has **clear, measurable KPIs** driving product decisions. ClinMetrics Pro lacks operational metrics infrastructure.

**Recommendation**: Implement **product analytics** (Mixpanel, Amplitude, or custom) to track:
- DAU, WAU, MAU (daily/weekly/monthly active users)
- Alerts per user per day
- Time-to-acknowledge, time-to-resolve
- Notes per user per day
- Minutes logged per user per day
- Patient panel size per care manager

### Strategic Timing Analysis

**RPM Workflow Optimizer Advantage**: Focused 4-5 week sprint to MVP with immediate pilot deployment.

**ClinMetrics Pro Timeline**:
- Phase 1 planned for Q4 2025 (current quarter)
- Pilot deployment in Phase 2 (Q1 2026)
- **6-month gap from now to pilot**

**Risk**: If RPM Workflow Optimizer ships an MVP in 5 weeks while ClinMetrics Pro takes 6 months to pilot, we lose first-mover advantage in the "workflow optimizer" positioning.

**Recommendation**: **Accelerate Phase 1** by adopting RPM Workflow Optimizer's focused scope:
1. Triage queue
2. Task management
3. Smart documentation
4. Time tracking automation
5. Billing readiness dashboard

**Revised Timeline**:
- **Phase 1a (Immediate - 6 weeks)**: Workflow optimizer features (triage, tasks, notes, timers, billing)
- **Phase 1b (Following 2 weeks)**: Authentication testing, enhanced notifications
- **Phase 2 (Q1 2026)**: Pilot deployment (no changes)

**Result**: Pilot-ready platform in **8 weeks** instead of 6 months.

## Competitive Positioning

### If We Adopt RPM Workflow Optimizer Concepts

**Positioning**: *"ClinMetrics Pro: The only RPM platform combining clinical standards with workflow optimization"*

**Value Props**:
1. **Standards-Based Clinical Library** (ClinMetrics Pro unique)
2. **Workflow Efficiency Tools** (RPM Workflow Optimizer concepts)
3. **Research-Ready Data** (ClinMetrics Pro unique)
4. **Multi-Tenant SaaS** (both platforms)

**Target Market Segments**:
- **Academic Medical Centers**: Need standards + research capabilities
- **Community Health Clinics**: Need workflow efficiency + billing compliance
- **Care Management Organizations**: Need scalability + operational metrics
- **Clinical Research Institutions**: Need validated instruments + data export

**Competitive Advantage**: **Only platform that serves both research and operations**. Competitors force customers to choose between clinical rigor and operational efficiency.

---

### If We Don't Adopt RPM Workflow Optimizer Concepts

**Risk**: ClinMetrics Pro becomes a "monitoring system" that collects data but doesn't drive workflow efficiency.

**Competitor Positioning**:
- **RPM Workflow Optimizer**: "We optimize workflows, ClinMetrics Pro just collects data"
- **ClinMetrics Pro**: "We have validated instruments, RPM Workflow Optimizer is just operations"

**Result**: **Market fragmentation** - academic customers choose ClinMetrics Pro, community clinics choose RPM Workflow Optimizer. Both platforms serve only half the market.

**Strategic Implication**: We MUST adopt workflow optimization features to achieve **total addressable market (TAM) dominance**.

---

## Integration Strategy

### Option A: Build Workflow Features In-House (Recommended)

**Pros**:
- Full control over UX and integration with standards library
- Unified data model (no sync issues)
- Single support burden
- Stronger IP position

**Cons**:
- 6-8 weeks development time
- Opportunity cost (delays other features)

**Recommendation**: **Adopt this approach** - Workflow features are core to value prop, not a separate product.

---

### Option B: Partner/Acquire RPM Workflow Optimizer

**Pros**:
- Faster time-to-market (if RPM Workflow Optimizer is already built)
- Proven workflow UX
- Access to existing customer base (if any)

**Cons**:
- Integration complexity (two codebases)
- Potential misalignment on data models
- Cultural integration challenges
- Cost (acquisition or revenue share)

**Assessment**: **Only viable if RPM Workflow Optimizer is already shipping product**. If it's just a spec (like this document), Option A is faster.

---

### Option C: Modular Approach (Not Recommended)

**Concept**: Build workflow features as a separate "ClinMetrics Workflows" add-on module.

**Cons**:
- Fragmented user experience
- Data sync complexity
- Higher maintenance burden
- Confusing sales story

**Recommendation**: **Avoid** - Workflow optimization should be core, not optional.

---

## Risk Analysis

### Risk 1: Scope Creep in Phase 1

**Problem**: Adding triage, tasks, notes, timers, and billing dashboards to Phase 1 increases scope by 50%.

**Mitigation**:
- Use RPM Workflow Optimizer spec as **MVP definition** - only build features listed as "P0" priority
- Defer "nice-to-have" features (saved views, bulk actions, daily wrap-up) to Phase 2
- Parallel work: PM/Designer on UX while engineer completes authentication testing

**Impact**: Extends Phase 1 from 4 weeks to 6-8 weeks, but delivers pilot-ready product.

---

### Risk 2: User Adoption if Workflow UX is Poor

**Problem**: Workflow features require **excellent UX** to drive efficiency. Poor UX (clunky triage queue, confusing task management) could increase time-per-alert instead of decreasing it.

**Mitigation**:
- Invest in **UX research** with target users (care managers at pilot clinic)
- Conduct **usability testing** on wireframes before implementation
- **Iterative design** - ship v1, measure time-per-alert, refine based on data

**Success Criteria**: Time-per-alert <20 minutes (vs RPM Workflow Optimizer's <30 min target)

---

### Risk 3: Clinical Monitoring Engine Still Missing

**Problem**: Even with workflow features, ClinMetrics Pro cannot **automatically trigger alerts** based on observations (per clinical-monitoring-gap-analysis.md).

**Strategic Decision**:
- **Option A**: Build workflow features first (Phase 1a), then alert evaluation engine (Phase 1b)
  - Pro: Workflow UX enables manual alert triage immediately
  - Con: Still requires manual alert creation for 6-8 weeks

- **Option B**: Build alert evaluation engine first (Phase 1a), then workflow features (Phase 1b)
  - Pro: Automatic alert triggering sooner
  - Con: Poor workflow UX delays pilot clinic onboarding

**Recommendation**: **Option A** - Workflow features have higher user impact. Alert evaluation can be built in parallel by second engineer (if available).
