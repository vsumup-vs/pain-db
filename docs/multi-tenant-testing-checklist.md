## Prerequisites for Testing

### Test Organizations Setup

You need at least 2 test organizations to verify isolation:

- **Organization A** (e.g., "Hospital ABC")
- **Organization B** (e.g., "Clinic XYZ")

### Test Users Setup

Create test users with access to different organizations:

- **User 1**: Member of Organization A only
- **User 2**: Member of Organization B only
- **User 3**: Member of both organizations (to test org switching)
- **Platform Admin**: Has `isPlatformAdmin: true` flag

## Known Issues / Limitations

1. **Platform Admin View**: Currently platform admins see standardized + their org's items. Future enhancement: Admin dashboard showing all orgs.

2. **Standardized Metric Edit**: Edit button may need conditional logic to prevent direct edit of standardized items (guide to customize first).

3. **Condition Presets & Alert Rules**: Not yet implemented. Follow same pattern when ready (Phase 1 - Phase 2).

---

## Testing Environment Setup

### Database State Verification

Before testing, verify database state:

```sql
-- Check standardized metrics count
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM metric_definitions WHERE "organizationId" IS NULL AND "isStandardized" = true;
-- Expected: 26

-- Check standardized templates count
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM assessment_templates WHERE "organizationId" IS NULL AND "isStandardized" = true;
-- Expected: 8

-- Check organizations exist
SELECT id, name, type FROM organizations WHERE name != 'Platform Administration';
-- Should have at least 2 test organizations
```

### API Testing Tools

- **Browser DevTools**: Network tab for API inspection
- **Postman/Insomnia**: For direct API testing
- **Prisma Studio**: For database inspection (`npx prisma studio`)
