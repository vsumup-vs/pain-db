> **Summary**: Fixed critical Prisma validation errors in platform organization controller

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

### 1. Platform Organization Details View - Field Name Corrections

**Priority**: P0 - Critical (blocking organization details page)

**Problem**: Organization details page returning 500 Internal Server Error
- Backend using incorrect field name `alerts` instead of `supportTickets`
- Multiple PrismaClientValidationError instances blocking platform admin functionality
- Error: `Unknown field 'alerts' for select statement on model OrganizationCountOutputType`

**Root Cause**:
```
PrismaClientValidationError:
Invalid `prisma.organization.findUnique()` invocation...
Unknown argument `alerts`. Available options are marked with ?.
Field 'alerts' doesn't exist on OrganizationCountOutputType.
Correct field name is 'supportTickets'.
```

**Solution**:
- ‚úÖ Fixed Line 290: Changed `alerts: true` ‚Üí `supportTickets: true` in _count select
- ‚úÖ Fixed Line 613: Changed `alerts: true` ‚Üí `supportTickets: true` in _count select (second occurrence in getAllOrganizations function)
- ‚úÖ Fixed Line 352: Changed `organization._count.alerts` ‚Üí `organization._count.supportTickets` in usage object (from previous session)

**Impact**:
- Organization details page now loading successfully
- Platform admin can view organization overview, subscription, usage, billing, and support sections
- All organization _count queries working correctly
- User confirmed: "page is loading now - no more 500 error!"

**Files Modified**:
- `src/controllers/platformOrganizationController.js` (lines 290, 613)

**Changes Summary**:
