## Overview

Implement a compliance tracking dashboard that shows which patients meet CMS billing requirements for RPM/RTM/CCM programs, with exportable monthly billing packages for finance teams.

**Current Problem**: RPM coordinators manually calculate billing eligibility by:
- Exporting TimeLog entries to spreadsheet
- Counting observation days per patient
- Cross-referencing CMS requirements (CCM: 20+ min, RPM: 16+ days readings, RTM: 20+ min + 16+ days)
- Manually creating billing packages for finance

This takes 4-8 hours per month and is error-prone.

**Success Criteria**: >95% billing package readiness by month 3 (vs current manual process)

## User Stories

### RPM Coordinator Monthly Billing Preparation

As an RPM coordinator, I want a dashboard showing which patients meet billing requirements, so that I can prepare billing packages in 30 minutes instead of 4-8 hours.

**Current Workflow (Manual - 4-8 hours)**:
1. Export all TimeLog entries for the month to CSV
2. Export all Observation entries for the month to CSV
3. Create spreadsheet with formulas to:
   - Sum minutes per patient
   - Count unique observation days per patient
   - Compare to CMS thresholds
4. Manually flag eligible patients
5. Create billing package spreadsheet for finance
6. Email to billing team

**New Workflow (Automated - 30 minutes)**:
1. Open Billing Readiness Dashboard
2. Select month/year
3. See patient eligibility table:
   - ðŸŸ¢ Eligible (45 patients)
   - ðŸŸ¡ Close - need 2 more days of readings (8 patients)
   - ðŸ”´ Not Eligible - need 10+ minutes (12 patients)
4. Click "Export Billing Package CSV"
5. Download includes: patient ID, name, program type, minutes logged, reading days, CPT codes, eligible amounts
6. Email CSV to finance team

### Care Manager Proactive Intervention

As a care manager, I want to see which of my patients are close to billing thresholds, so that I can prioritize interventions to ensure they remain eligible.

**Workflow**:
1. Mid-month: Open "My Patients' Billing Status" view
2. See 3 patients flagged ðŸŸ¡ Close:
   - Patient A: Has 18 minutes logged (need 2 more for CCM)
   - Patient B: Has 14 reading days (need 2 more for RPM)
   - Patient C: Has 15 minutes + 14 days (need 5 min + 2 days for RTM)
3. Create tasks: "Schedule follow-up call with Patient A" to log additional time
4. Create tasks: "Remind Patient B to take daily readings"
5. End of month: All 3 patients now ðŸŸ¢ Eligible
