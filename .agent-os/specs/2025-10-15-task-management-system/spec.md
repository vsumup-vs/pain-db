> Spec: Task Management System
> Created: 2025-10-15
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement a comprehensive task management system that enables care managers and clinicians to systematically track follow-up actions, assignments, and clinical workflows with due dates, priorities, and status tracking. This feature transforms ad-hoc follow-up practices into a structured workflow that ensures no patient care actions fall through the cracks.

## User Stories

### Care Manager Task Tracking

As a care manager, I want to create and track follow-up tasks for my patients, so that I can ensure timely interventions and maintain accountability for patient care actions.

**Workflow:**
1. Care manager reviews an alert for a patient with elevated blood pressure
2. Acknowledges the alert and decides a follow-up call is needed in 3 days
3. System auto-creates a task: "Follow-up call for BP check" due in 3 days, assigned to care manager
4. On day 3, care manager sees the task in "My Tasks - Due Today" view
5. Completes the call, marks task as "Completed" with optional notes
6. Task appears in completed history with completion timestamp

### Team Coordination with Task Assignment

As a care coordinator, I want to assign specific clinical tasks to appropriate team members, so that work is distributed efficiently and specialists handle their areas of expertise.

**Workflow:**
1. Care coordinator identifies that a diabetic patient needs medication review
2. Creates task: "Review diabetes medications" assigned to clinical pharmacist
3. Sets priority to "High" with due date in 2 days
4. Pharmacist receives task notification and sees it in their "My Tasks" view
5. Pharmacist reviews medications, documents findings in task notes
6. Marks task as "Completed" - care coordinator sees completion in patient record

### Bulk Task Management for Overdue Follow-Ups

As a clinical supervisor, I want to view and manage overdue tasks across my team, so that I can ensure patient safety and identify workflow bottlenecks.

**Workflow:**
1. Supervisor navigates to Tasks page with "Overdue" filter
2. Sees list of 15 overdue tasks across 5 team members
3. Selects 3 tasks related to routine follow-ups (low priority)
4. Uses bulk action to reschedule all 3 to tomorrow
5. Selects 2 high-priority overdue tasks
6. Bulk reassigns to available care manager with notes explaining urgency

## Spec Scope

1. **Task Model & Database** - New Task model with fields: taskType (enum), title, description, assignedTo, assignedBy, dueDate, priority (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH/URGENT), status (PENDING/IN_PROGRESS/COMPLETED/CANCELLED), linkedAlert, linkedAssessment, linkedPatient, completedAt, completedBy, notes, timestamps
2. **Task CRUD API** - RESTful endpoints for creating, reading, updating, deleting tasks with organization-level isolation and RBAC permission checks
3. **Task Views & Filters** - Frontend page with filterable views: My Tasks, All Tasks (coordinators), Due Today, Due This Week, Overdue, By Patient, By Status, By Priority
4. **Task Assignment & Reassignment** - Ability to assign tasks to specific users within organization with reassignment workflow and notification
5. **Bulk Task Operations** - Multi-select tasks for bulk actions: assign, reassign, complete, cancel, reschedule, change priority
6. **Auto-Task Generation from Alerts** - When resolving alerts, option to create follow-up task with pre-populated patient context and suggested due date
7. **Task Integration with Patient Context** - Display recent and upcoming tasks in Patient Context Panel and patient detail pages
8. **Task Completion Workflow** - Mark tasks complete with optional completion notes, automatic timestamp, and completion audit trail

## Out of Scope

- Task templates or recurring task scheduling (Phase 2 feature)
- Task dependencies or subtask hierarchies (Phase 2 feature)
- Time tracking within tasks (separate Time Logging feature handles this)
- External calendar integration (Google Calendar, Outlook) (Phase 2 feature)
- Task notifications via email or SMS (covered by separate Enhanced Notification System spec in Phase 1b)
- Advanced task analytics and reporting dashboards (Phase 1b feature)

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Task Management Page**: Functional `/tasks` page with filters, sortable columns, task creation modal, bulk action controls, and responsive design for tablet use
2. **Alert-to-Task Workflow**: When acknowledging/resolving an alert in Triage Queue, "Create Follow-Up Task" option appears with pre-filled patient and alert context
3. **Patient Context Integration**: Patient detail pages and Patient Context Panel show upcoming tasks (next 7 days) and recent completed tasks (last 30 days) with click-to-view task details
4. **Task Completion**: Care managers can mark tasks complete from task list or patient context with optional completion notes, automatic status update, and audit log entry
5. **Multi-User Coordination**: Tasks assigned to User A appear in User A's "My Tasks" view; User B (coordinator role) can view all tasks and reassign as needed
