## 2025-10-10: Initial Product Planning & Agent OS Installation

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead, Development Team

### Decision

ClinMetrics Pro is a standards-based clinical metrics management platform enabling Remote Therapeutic Monitoring (RTM), Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM), and Chronic Care Management (CCM) programs. The platform provides authoritative condition presets, metrics, assessment templates, and alert rules derived from clinical standards bodies, while supporting full client-level customization and extensibility.

### Context

Healthcare organizations implementing remote monitoring programs face fragmented tools and inconsistent measurement approaches. Each clinic reinvents assessment protocols, leading to non-comparable data, compliance risks, and clinician burnout. The market lacks a solution that provides both standards-based clinical rigor and the flexibility to accommodate clinic-specific workflows and research requirements.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Generic Data Collection Platform**
   - Pros: Flexible, low development cost, fast to market
   - Cons: No clinical validity, no standards compliance, requires extensive clinic customization, no regulatory support

2. **Rigid Standards-Only Platform**
   - Pros: Regulatory compliance, clinical validity, consistent data
   - Cons: Inflexible, cannot accommodate research or clinic-specific needs, slow to evolve

3. **Fully Custom Solution per Client** (Selected Hybrid Approach)
   - Pros: Meets exact client needs, competitive differentiation
   - Cons: Expensive, slow scaling, inconsistent data across clients

### Rationale

We chose a hybrid approach that provides a curated standards-based library as the foundation while enabling full client-level extensibility. This approach:

1. **Ensures Clinical Validity:** All initial metrics, templates, and alert rules derive from authoritative standards (NIH PROMIS, validated instruments, evidence-based guidelines)
2. **Enables Customization:** Clinics can extend metrics, modify templates, create custom alert rules without compromising the standards foundation
3. **Supports Scalability:** Standard library accelerates onboarding while extensibility handles edge cases
4. **Maintains Traceability:** Every item maps back to source standards for auditability and clinical confidence

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Rapid clinic onboarding with pre-configured condition presets and protocols
- Regulatory compliance (HIPAA, potential FDA) built into foundation
- Comparable data across organizations due to standards adherence
- Competitive differentiation through extensibility vs rigid competitors
- Research-ready data structure supporting clinical trials and outcome studies

**Negative:**
- Increased complexity in maintaining standards library and version control
- Need for robust documentation of standards sources and update mechanisms
- Potential confusion between "standard" and "custom" content requiring clear UI distinction
- Higher initial development investment to build extensibility framework

## 2025-10-10: Multi-Tenant Architecture with Organization Isolation

**ID:** DEC-002
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, Security Lead, Product Owner

### Decision

Implement multi-tenant architecture with organization-level data isolation, role-based access control (RBAC), and comprehensive audit logging to support diverse healthcare organizations (hospitals, clinics, research institutions) on a shared infrastructure.

### Context

Healthcare data privacy (HIPAA) requires strict data isolation between organizations. The platform serves multiple organization types (hospitals, clinics, practices, research institutions, insurance, pharmacy) with different security and compliance requirements. A multi-tenant architecture enables scalable SaaS deployment while maintaining regulatory compliance.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Single-Tenant Deployment per Client**
   - Pros: Maximum isolation, simple security model
   - Cons: High infrastructure costs, slow onboarding, difficult to update, no economies of scale

2. **Shared Database with Row-Level Security** (Selected)
   - Pros: Cost-effective, simplified operations, rapid onboarding
   - Cons: Requires rigorous access control implementation, potential for misconfiguration

3. **Database-per-Tenant**
   - Pros: Strong isolation, independent scaling per client
   - Cons: High operational complexity, backup/restore challenges, schema migration complexity

### Rationale

We implemented a shared database with organization-level isolation enforced through:
- **Organization Model:** All core entities link to Organization (patients, clinicians, care programs, enrollments)
- **UserOrganization Model:** Junction table managing user membership and roles per organization
- **RBAC Permissions Enum:** Granular permissions (USER_CREATE, PATIENT_READ, ORG_BILLING_MANAGE, etc.) assigned per user-organization relationship
- **Prisma Query Filters:** Organization ID filtering enforced at the ORM level
- **Audit Logging:** All actions tracked with organizationId, userId, resource changes for compliance

This approach balances cost-efficiency with security while enabling rapid multi-organization deployment.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Cost-effective infrastructure scaling across multiple organizations
- Rapid onboarding of new clinics without infrastructure provisioning delays
- Centralized security updates and compliance improvements benefit all tenants
- Comprehensive audit trail supports HIPAA compliance and breach detection
- Flexible role assignment (user can have different roles in different organizations)

**Negative:**
- Risk of cross-tenant data leakage if access controls are misconfigured (requires rigorous testing)
- Noisy neighbor potential (one organization's load impacts others, requires resource limits)
- Complex backup/restore for individual organizations
- Cannot offer client-specific schema customization

## 2025-10-10: Prisma ORM with Hybrid Raw SQL Strategy

**ID:** DEC-003
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, Backend Team

### Decision

Use Prisma ORM as the primary data persistence layer for type-safe CRUD operations, with a hybrid strategy that introduces raw SQL for complex queries, FHIR transformations, device data ingestion, and analytics starting in Phase 2-3.

### Context

The platform requires robust relational data management for complex healthcare entities (patients, enrollments, observations, assessments) with strict referential integrity and HIPAA audit requirements. Developer productivity and type safety are critical for rapid feature development. However, upcoming requirements (FHIR implementation, device integration, population analytics) will require advanced PostgreSQL features and query optimization that Prisma doesn't fully support.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Raw SQL with pg Driver Only**
   - Pros: Maximum performance control, no abstraction overhead, full PostgreSQL feature access
   - Cons: No type safety, manual migration management, SQL injection risk, slow development, security risk for multi-tenant isolation

2. **Prisma ORM Only**
   - Pros: Type safety, rapid development, automated migrations, excellent developer experience
   - Cons: Limited PostgreSQL features, performance bottlenecks for complex analytics, verbose FHIR transformations

3. **Hybrid: Prisma + Raw SQL** (Selected)
   - Pros: Type safety for CRUD, raw SQL for complex operations, optimal performance, security for simple operations
   - Cons: Mixed patterns require developer judgment, raw SQL loses type safety

4. **Knex.js Query Builder**
   - Pros: More control than Prisma, less verbose than raw SQL
   - Cons: Still no type safety, doesn't solve complex query optimization

### Rationale

**Prisma Foundation (Phase 0-2):**

Prisma provides optimal developer experience for core clinical workflows:
- **Type Safety:** Generated TypeScript types eliminate runtime type errors in multi-tenant queries
- **Multi-Tenant Security:** Organization-level filtering enforced at ORM level reduces cross-tenant data leak risk
- **Automated Migrations:** `prisma migrate` handles schema evolution with version control
- **Rapid CRUD Development:** User, Patient, Clinician, Enrollment, Assessment management
- **Developer Tools:** Prisma Studio for debugging, excellent IDE auto-complete

**Raw SQL Enhancement (Phase 2-3):**

Introduce `prisma.$queryRaw` and `prisma.$executeRaw` for specialized use cases:

1. **FHIR Resource Transformations (Phase 2):**
```javascript
// Complex JSON transformations for FHIR Patient resource
const fhirPatient = await prisma.$queryRaw`
  SELECT jsonb_build_object(
    'resourceType', 'Patient',
    'id', p.id::text,
    'identifier', jsonb_build_array(
      jsonb_build_object('system', 'urn:mrn', 'value', p.medical_record_number)
    ),
    'name', jsonb_build_array(
      jsonb_build_object('family', p.last_name, 'given', jsonb_build_array(p.first_name))
    ),
    'birthDate', p.date_of_birth::date
  ) as resource
  FROM patients p
  WHERE p.id = ${patientId} AND p.organization_id = ${organizationId}
`;
```

2. **High-Volume Device Data Ingestion (Phase 3):**
```javascript
// Bulk insert with conflict handling for device observations
await prisma.$executeRaw`
  INSERT INTO observations (patient_id, metric_id, value, source, recorded_at, created_at, updated_at)
  SELECT * FROM UNNEST(
    ${Prisma.join(patientIds)}::text[],
    ${Prisma.join(metricIds)}::text[],
    ${Prisma.join(values)}::jsonb[],
    ${Prisma.join(sources)}::text[],
    ${Prisma.join(timestamps)}::timestamp[],
    ${Prisma.join(timestamps)}::timestamp[],
    ${Prisma.join(timestamps)}::timestamp[]
  )
  ON CONFLICT (patient_id, metric_id, recorded_at) DO NOTHING
`;
```

3. **Population Health Analytics (Phase 3):**
```javascript
// Window functions for trend detection across patient cohort
const trends = await prisma.$queryRaw`
  WITH patient_metrics AS (
    SELECT
      o.patient_id,
      o.value::numeric as value,
      o.recorded_at,
      AVG(o.value::numeric) OVER (
        PARTITION BY o.patient_id
        ORDER BY o.recorded_at
        ROWS BETWEEN 6 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
      ) as rolling_avg_7day
    FROM observations o
    INNER JOIN enrollments e ON e.patient_id = o.patient_id
    WHERE o.metric_id = ${metricId}
      AND e.organization_id = ${organizationId}
      AND o.recorded_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
  )
  SELECT patient_id, value, rolling_avg_7day
  FROM patient_metrics
  WHERE rolling_avg_7day > ${threshold}
  ORDER BY patient_id, recorded_at DESC
`;
```

4. **Real-Time Alert Evaluation (Phase 3):**
```javascript
// Complex multi-parameter alert logic with CTEs
const triggeredAlerts = await prisma.$queryRaw`
  WITH recent_observations AS (
    SELECT patient_id, metric_id, value, recorded_at
    FROM observations
    WHERE recorded_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
      AND patient_id = ANY(${patientIds})
  ),
  violation_checks AS (
    SELECT
      ro.patient_id,
      ar.id as rule_id,
      ar.severity,
      COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE (ro.value::numeric) > (ar.conditions->>'threshold')::numeric) as violation_count
    FROM recent_observations ro
    CROSS JOIN alert_rules ar
    WHERE ar.is_active = true
    GROUP BY ro.patient_id, ar.id, ar.severity
  )
  SELECT * FROM violation_checks
  WHERE violation_count >= 3
`;
```

**Hybrid Strategy Guidelines:**

**Use Prisma for:**
- User, Organization, Patient, Clinician CRUD operations
- Enrollment creation and status updates
- Assessment template management
- Audit log writes (security-critical, type-safe)
- Simple queries with straightforward filtering

**Use Raw SQL for:**
- FHIR resource JSON transformations
- Bulk device data imports (>100 records/batch)
- Population analytics with window functions, CTEs
- Real-time alert evaluation with multi-table joins
- Full-text search with `ts_vector` ranking
- Custom aggregate functions (e.g., percentile calculations)

**PostgreSQL Selection Rationale:**
- **HIPAA Compliance:** Mature security features, encryption at rest/transit, audit logging
- **JSON/JSONB Support:** Native JSON columns for flexible metadata (observations, assessment responses, FHIR resources)
- **Full-Text Search:** Built-in `tsvector` for patient/clinician search
- **Window Functions:** Essential for trend detection and rolling aggregates
- **Proven Healthcare Scale:** Used by Epic, Cerner, major EHR systems
- **Advanced Indexing:** GIN indexes for JSON, trigram indexes for fuzzy search

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- **Phase 0-1 Velocity:** Prisma accelerates clinical workflow development with type safety and security
- **Phase 2-3 Performance:** Raw SQL enables FHIR, device integration, analytics without performance bottlenecks
- **Security Maintained:** Prisma handles sensitive CRUD operations with type-safe organization filtering
- **Developer Flexibility:** Developers can choose appropriate tool based on query complexity
- **PostgreSQL Expertise Leveraged:** Team can use full database capabilities when needed

**Negative:**
- **Mixed Patterns:** Developers must learn when to use Prisma vs raw SQL (documented in CLAUDE.md)
- **Type Safety Loss:** Raw SQL queries lose compile-time type checking (mitigated by testing)
- **Maintenance Overhead:** Two query patterns to maintain and optimize
- **Migration Complexity:** Raw SQL queries must be manually updated when schema changes
- **Learning Curve:** Junior developers may struggle with complex PostgreSQL queries

### Migration Path (If Full Raw SQL Needed)

If Prisma becomes a significant bottleneck (unlikely before Phase 4):

1. Generate TypeScript interfaces from Prisma schema
2. Create raw SQL query builders with type annotations (consider Zapatos or Slonik)
3. Implement custom migration system or adopt Knex migrations
4. Extensive testing to ensure organization isolation still works
5. Performance benchmarking to validate improvement justifies effort

**Current Assessment:** Hybrid approach sufficient through Phase 5. Full migration not recommended unless >30% of queries require raw SQL.
