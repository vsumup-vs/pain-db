## Pitch

ClinMetrics Pro is a standards-based clinical metrics management platform that enables Remote Therapeutic Monitoring (RTM), Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM), and Chronic Care Management (CCM) programs by providing authoritative, extensible condition presets, metrics, assessment templates, and alert rules—serving as a comprehensive initial library for clinics and researchers while supporting full client-level customization.

## Users

- **Goals:** Easily complete assessments, understand health trends, feel connected to care team

## The Problem

### Lack of Standardization in Remote Monitoring

Healthcare organizations implementing RTM/RPM/CCM programs face fragmented tools and inconsistent measurement approaches. Each clinic reinvents assessment protocols, leading to non-comparable data, compliance risks, and clinician burnout from managing disparate systems.

**Our Solution:** Provide a curated library of condition presets, metrics, and assessment templates drawn from authoritative clinical standards (e.g., NIH PROMIS, validated pain scales, evidence-based guidelines), ensuring measurement consistency and regulatory compliance from day one.

### Inability to Customize Standard Workflows

While standardization is critical, one-size-fits-all platforms fail to accommodate clinic-specific protocols, research requirements, or evolving clinical evidence. Organizations are forced to choose between rigid standardization or completely custom (and expensive) solutions.

**Our Solution:** Offer full extensibility at the client level—clinics and researchers can customize metrics, create new assessment templates, define custom alert rules, and extend condition presets while maintaining the integrity of the standards-based foundation.

### Inefficient Clinical Alert Systems

Existing monitoring platforms generate excessive false-positive alerts or fail to detect clinically significant changes, leading to alert fatigue and delayed intervention. Clinicians waste time triaging non-actionable notifications.

**Our Solution:** Implement evidence-based, condition-specific alert rules with configurable thresholds and multi-parameter logic, ensuring clinicians receive actionable, prioritized notifications that drive timely clinical decisions.

### Complex Multi-Tenant Infrastructure Requirements

Healthcare IT departments struggle to deploy monitoring solutions across multiple organizations, clinics, and care teams while maintaining data isolation, role-based access, and compliance with HIPAA requirements.

**Our Solution:** Built-in multi-tenant architecture with organization-level isolation, granular role-based access control (RBAC), comprehensive audit logging, and HIPAA-aligned security controls—enabling secure, scalable deployment across diverse healthcare environments.

## Differentiators

### Standards-Based Clinical Library

Unlike generic data collection platforms, we provide an authoritative library of condition presets, metrics, and assessment templates derived from clinical standards bodies (NIH PROMIS, validated instruments, evidence-based guidelines). This results in immediate deployment readiness, regulatory compliance, and data comparability across organizations.

### Client-Level Extensibility with Standards Integrity

While competitors offer either rigid standardization or completely custom builds, we enable full customization at the client level—clinics can extend metrics, modify templates, and create custom workflows—while maintaining traceability to source standards and ensuring data integrity.

### Evidence-Based Alert Intelligence

Our condition-specific alert rules are built from clinical evidence and best practices, not arbitrary thresholds. Multi-parameter logic, severity stratification, and configurable escalation paths ensure clinicians receive actionable alerts that improve outcomes while reducing alert fatigue.

### Open API Architecture for Device & EHR Integration

From the ground up, we're building open, well-documented APIs to enable seamless integration with wearable devices, RPM equipment, and EHR systems. This future-proofs the platform and accelerates third-party innovation in the remote monitoring ecosystem.
