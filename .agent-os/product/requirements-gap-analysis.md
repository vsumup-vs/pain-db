| **Data Governance (Consent, Retention, Deletion)** | ðŸŸ¡ Partial | Audit logging comprehensive. No patient consent management model. No data retention policies. No right-to-deletion workflows (GDPR/CCPA). | Phase 1-2 |

### Gaps & Recommendations

**Critical Gaps:**
- No patient consent management (HIPAA requirement for specific uses/disclosures)
- No data retention policies or automated archival
- No right-to-deletion implementation (GDPR/CCPA)
- No FDA SaMD classification assessment
- No SOC 2 audit completed

**Recommended Actions:**
1. **Phase 1 (Immediate):** Implement patient consent management (Compliance Risk)
   - Create Consent model (patient, consentType, consentText, agreedAt, revokedAt)
   - Consent types: Treatment, Research, Marketing, Data Sharing
   - Capture consent in registration flow and enrollment workflows
   - Link consent to audit logs for PHI access justification
2. **Phase 1:** Document data retention policies (Compliance Requirement)
   - Define retention periods by data type (observations, assessments, audit logs)
   - Document legal basis (HIPAA minimum 6 years, state laws)
3. **Phase 2:** Implement right-to-deletion workflows (GDPR/CCPA Compliance)
   - Patient data export (JSON/PDF)
   - Data anonymization for retained analytics
   - Audit log retention exception (7 years)
4. **Phase 2:** Pursue SOC 2 Type II certification (Enterprise Sales Requirement)
   - Engage SOC 2 auditor (Q1 2026)
   - Implement control evidence collection automation
   - Complete audit by Q2 2026
5. **Phase 2:** Evaluate FDA SaMD classification (Regulatory Counsel)
   - Assess if clinical decision support triggers FDA regulation
   - Determine if 510(k) clearance required
   - If yes, plan FDA submission process (add 12-18 months)

**Strategic Note:** FDA SaMD classification depends on product positioning. If marketed as "clinical decision support that clinicians review," may avoid FDA regulation. Consult regulatory counsel before pilot launch.
