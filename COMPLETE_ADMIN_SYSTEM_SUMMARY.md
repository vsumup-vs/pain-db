## 🔐 Security Features

### 1. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

**SUPER_ADMIN:**
- Create/edit/delete any organization
- Manage users across all organizations
- Assign users to any organization with any role
- View all audit logs
- Full platform access

**ORG_ADMIN:**
- View only their organization(s)
- Manage users within their organization
- Cannot create new organizations
- Cannot access other organizations' data

**Regular Users (CLINICIAN, NURSE, etc.):**
- No admin access
- Admin section hidden in navigation
- Can only work with patient data

### 2. Data Isolation

**Every API request:**
- JWT token with organization context
- Middleware validates organization access
- All queries automatically filtered by organizationId
- Cross-org access attempts logged and blocked (404 response)

### 3. Audit Logging

**All admin actions logged:**
- ORGANIZATION_CREATED
- ORGANIZATION_UPDATED
- ORGANIZATION_DELETED
- ROLE_ASSIGNED
- UNAUTHORIZED_ORG_ACCESS
- All flagged as hipaaRelevant: true

**Audit Log Includes:**
- userId, organizationId
- Action type
- Old and new values
- IP address, user agent
- Timestamp
- Metadata (details)

### 4. Permission Checking

**Backend:**
- `requirePermission('ORG_CREATE')` middleware
- Permission arrays stored per user-organization
- SYSTEM_ADMIN permission bypasses all checks

**Frontend:**
- Role-based navigation visibility
- API returns 403 for unauthorized requests
- User-friendly error messages

## 📝 Example Workflows

### Workflow 1: Onboard New Hospital

```
1. SUPER_ADMIN logs in
2. Navigate to Organizations
3. Click [+ New Organization]
4. Fill in hospital details
5. Click [Create]
6. Navigate to Users
7. Click [+ New User]
8. Create ORG_ADMIN for hospital
9. Email welcome to ORG_ADMIN
10. ORG_ADMIN logs in
11. ORG_ADMIN invites clinicians
12. Hospital starts onboarding patients
```

### Workflow 2: Consultant Works at Multiple Hospitals

```
1. SUPER_ADMIN creates user
2. Assign to Hospital A as CLINICIAN
3. Assign to Hospital B as CLINICIAN
4. User logs in
5. Organization Selector shows both hospitals
6. User selects Hospital A
7. Dashboard shows Hospital A data only
8. User logs out and back in
9. Selects Hospital B
10. Dashboard shows Hospital B data only
```

### Workflow 3: Audit Cross-Org Access Attempt

```
1. User A from Hospital A logs in
2. User A tries to access Patient ID from Hospital B
   (e.g., manually enters URL or manipulates API call)
3. Backend middleware detects cross-org access
4. Returns 404 (not 403 to avoid info disclosure)
5. Audit log created:
   - action: UNAUTHORIZED_ORG_ACCESS
   - userId: User A ID
   - metadata: { attemptedPatientId, attemptedOrg }
   - hipaaRelevant: true
6. Security team reviews audit logs
7. User A flagged for suspicious activity
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Organizations" page returns empty

**Cause:** User doesn't have SUPER_ADMIN or ORG_ADMIN role

**Solution:**
```bash
# Run setup script to make test@example.com a SUPER_ADMIN
node setup-super-admin.js
```

### Issue: Admin navigation not showing

**Cause:** User role check failing or user doesn't have admin role

**Solution:**
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify `/api/auth/me` returns correct user data
3. Ensure user has SUPER_ADMIN or ORG_ADMIN role
4. Clear localStorage and re-login

### Issue: "Permission denied" when creating organization

**Cause:** User doesn't have ORG_CREATE permission

**Solution:**
```sql
-- Check user permissions
SELECT
  u.email,
  uo.role,
  uo.permissions
FROM users u
JOIN user_organizations uo ON u.id = uo.userId
WHERE u.email = 'test@example.com';

-- Expected: permissions array includes 'ORG_CREATE'
```

### Issue: Organization selector not appearing

**Cause:** Backend not returning `requiresOrganizationSelection`

**Solution:**
- Verify user has multiple organizations
- Check `/api/auth/login` response
- Should include `requiresOrganizationSelection: true`
