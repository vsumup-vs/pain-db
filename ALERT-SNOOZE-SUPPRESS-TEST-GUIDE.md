# Alert Snooze/Suppress - Browser Testing Guide

> Created: 2025-10-22
> Feature: Phase 1b - Alert Snooze & Suppress with Reason Codes
> Status: Implementation Complete - Ready for Testing

## Quick Start: 3-Step Verification

### Step 1: Navigate to Triage Queue

1. Open browser to `http://localhost:5174/triage-queue`
2. Log in with test credentials (if not already logged in)
3. You should see the Triage Queue dashboard with active alerts

### Step 2: Test Snooze Functionality

**Goal**: Temporarily hide an alert for a specified duration (1 minute to 1 week)

1. **Find an active alert** in PENDING, ACKNOWLEDGED, or IN_PROGRESS status
2. **Click the "Snooze" button** (should be visible in alert action buttons)
3. **Snooze Modal should appear** with:
   - Patient name and alert details
   - Duration selector (dropdown with preset options OR custom input)
   - Optional reason/notes field
4. **Select snooze duration**:
   - Quick test: Select "5 minutes" or "15 minutes"
   - Options should include: 15 min, 30 min, 1 hour, 2 hours, 4 hours, 8 hours, 24 hours
5. **Click "Confirm" or "Snooze Alert"**
6. **Verify success**:
   - Toast notification: "Alert snoozed successfully"
   - Alert status changes to SNOOZED
   - Alert disappears from main active queue
   - Alert may appear in a "Snoozed Alerts" section (if UI has this filter)

### Step 3: Test Suppress Functionality

**Goal**: Permanently dismiss an alert with documented reason for audit compliance

1. **Find an active alert** (or use a different alert than the snoozed one)
2. **Click the "Suppress" button**
3. **Suppress Modal should appear** with:
   - Patient name and alert details
   - **Required** suppress reason dropdown
   - **Required** suppress notes textarea (minimum 10 characters for "OTHER" reason)
4. **Select suppress reason** from dropdown:
   - FALSE_POSITIVE
   - PATIENT_CONTACTED
   - DUPLICATE_ALERT
   - PLANNED_INTERVENTION
   - PATIENT_HOSPITALIZED
   - DEVICE_MALFUNCTION
   - DATA_ENTRY_ERROR
   - CLINICAL_JUDGMENT
   - OTHER (requires detailed notes)
5. **Enter suppress notes**:
   - If reason = "OTHER": **REQUIRED**, minimum 10 characters
   - Otherwise: Optional but recommended for audit trail
6. **Click "Confirm" or "Suppress Alert"**
7. **Verify success**:
   - Toast notification: "Alert suppressed successfully"
   - Alert status changes to DISMISSED
   - `isSuppressed` flag set to `true`
   - Alert disappears from active queue
   - Alert may appear in "Dismissed/Suppressed Alerts" section

## Detailed Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Snooze Duration Validation

**Test Case**: Verify snooze duration constraints

1. Open Snooze Modal
2. Attempt to enter invalid durations:
   - **Less than 1 minute**: Should show error "Snooze duration must be at least 1 minute"
   - **More than 10080 minutes (1 week)**: Should show error "Snooze duration cannot exceed 10080 minutes (1 week)"
3. Enter valid duration (e.g., 60 minutes)
4. Submit - should succeed

**Expected Behavior**:
- Frontend validates duration before submission
- Backend validates again and returns 400 error if invalid
- User sees clear error message

---

### Scenario 2: Suppress Reason Validation

**Test Case**: Verify suppress reason is required and "OTHER" requires notes

1. **Without selecting reason**:
   - Click Suppress button
   - Leave reason dropdown blank
   - Click submit
   - **Expected**: Error "Suppress reason is required"

2. **With reason = "OTHER" but no notes**:
   - Select "OTHER" from dropdown
   - Leave notes blank
   - Click submit
   - **Expected**: Error "Suppress notes are required (minimum 10 characters) when reason is OTHER"

3. **With reason = "OTHER" and short notes**:
   - Select "OTHER"
   - Enter "too short" (9 characters)
   - **Expected**: Error "Suppress notes must be at least 10 characters"

4. **Valid suppression**:
   - Select "FALSE_POSITIVE"
   - Notes optional
   - **Expected**: Success

---

### Scenario 3: Background Job - Automatic Unsnooze

**Test Case**: Verify alerts automatically reactivate after snooze expires

1. **Create a short snooze**:
   - Snooze an alert for **5 minutes**
   - Note the current time
   - Verify alert disappears from queue

2. **Wait for snooze to expire**:
   - Wait 5-6 minutes
   - Background job runs every 5 minutes, so alert should reactivate within 5-10 minutes of snooze expiry

3. **Verify reactivation**:
   - Refresh Triage Queue page (or wait for real-time update if SSE is working)
   - Alert should reappear in PENDING status
   - `snoozedUntil` should be cleared (null)
   - `snoozedById` and `snoozedAt` should be cleared

4. **Check backend logs**:
   ```bash
   tail -f backend.log | grep "Reactivated snoozed alert"
   ```
   - Should see: "üîî Reactivated snoozed alert [alert-id]"

**Expected Backend Log Output**:
```
‚è∞ Checking for expired snoozed alerts...
üîî Reactivated snoozed alert clvjq5v4a0001...
‚úÖ Reactivated 1 snoozed alerts
```

---

### Scenario 4: Audit Trail Verification

**Test Case**: Verify all snooze/suppress actions are logged for HIPAA compliance

1. **Perform snooze action** on an alert
2. **Check database audit logs**:
   ```bash
   npx prisma studio
   ```
   - Open `AuditLog` table
   - Find most recent entries with `action = 'ALERT_SNOOZED'`
   - Verify fields populated:
     - `userId` = current user
     - `organizationId` = alert's organization
     - `resource = 'Alert'`
     - `resourceId` = alert ID
     - `hipaaRelevant = true`
     - `oldValues` = previous alert status
     - `newValues` = new status with snooze details

3. **Perform suppress action**
4. **Check audit logs** for `action = 'ALERT_SUPPRESSED'`
   - Verify similar fields populated
   - Check `newValues` includes suppress reason and notes

**SQL Query (if needed)**:
```sql
SELECT * FROM audit_logs
WHERE action IN ('ALERT_SNOOZED', 'ALERT_SUPPRESSED', 'ALERT_UNSNOOZED', 'ALERT_UNSUPPRESSED')
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

---

### Scenario 5: Unsnooze and Unsuppress Actions

**Test Case**: Verify manual unsnooze and unsuppress functionality

1. **Snooze an alert** (e.g., 1 hour)
2. **View snoozed alerts** (filter or dedicated section)
3. **Click "Unsnooze" button** on the snoozed alert
4. **Verify**:
   - Alert returns to PENDING status immediately
   - Snooze fields cleared
   - Toast: "Alert unsnoozed successfully"

5. **Suppress an alert**
6. **View suppressed/dismissed alerts**
7. **Click "Unsuppress" button**
8. **Verify**:
   - Alert returns to PENDING status
   - `isSuppressed` set to `false`
   - Suppress reason/notes retained for audit (not cleared)
   - Toast: "Alert unsuppressed successfully"

## Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: Snooze/Suppress buttons not visible

**Possible Causes**:
- User doesn't have required permissions
- Alert status doesn't allow snooze/suppress (e.g., already RESOLVED)
- Frontend component not rendering buttons

**Check**:
1. Inspect browser DevTools ‚Üí Elements ‚Üí Find alert card
2. Look for button elements with onClick handlers
3. Check user permissions in database
4. Verify alert status is PENDING, ACKNOWLEDGED, or IN_PROGRESS

---

### Issue 2: Modal doesn't open

**Possible Causes**:
- Modal state not updating
- Modal component not imported
- JavaScript error preventing render

**Check**:
1. Browser console for errors (F12 ‚Üí Console)
2. Check `TriageQueue.jsx` imports:
   ```javascript
   import SnoozeModal from '../components/SnoozeModal'
   import SuppressModal from '../components/SuppressModal'
   ```
3. Check state variables:
   ```javascript
   const [isSnoozeModalOpen, setIsSnoozeModalOpen] = useState(false)
   const [isSuppressModalOpen, setIsSuppressModalOpen] = useState(false)
   ```

---

### Issue 3: API errors (400/500 responses)

**Possible Causes**:
- Invalid payload
- Missing required fields
- Backend validation errors

**Check**:
1. Browser DevTools ‚Üí Network tab ‚Üí Find failed POST request
2. Click on request ‚Üí Preview/Response tab
3. Read error message
4. Common errors:
   - "Snooze duration is required and must be at least 1 minute"
   - "Suppress reason is required"
   - "Suppress notes are required (minimum 10 characters) when reason is OTHER"

---

### Issue 4: Background job not reactivating alerts

**Possible Causes**:
- Background job not running
- Cron schedule misconfigured
- Database timezone issues

**Check**:
1. Backend logs: `tail -f backend.log | grep "expired snoozed"`
2. Should see "‚è∞ Checking for expired snoozed alerts..." every 5 minutes
3. Check alert `snoozedUntil` timestamp is in past
4. Manually trigger reactivation:
   ```javascript
   // In alertScheduler.js (for dev testing only)
   const { reactivateSnoozedAlerts } = require('./src/services/alertScheduler');
   reactivateSnoozedAlerts();
   ```
