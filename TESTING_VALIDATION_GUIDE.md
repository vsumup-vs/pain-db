## üß™ Manual Testing Procedures

### Test 1: Authentication Required

**Objective:** Verify that all API endpoints require authentication

**Steps:**
```bash
# 1. Try to access patients without authentication
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/patients
# Expected: 401 Unauthorized with AUTH_TOKEN_MISSING

# 2. Try with invalid token
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/patients \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer invalid-token"
# Expected: 401 Unauthorized with AUTH_TOKEN_INVALID
```

**Success Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ Returns 401 status code
- ‚úÖ Returns appropriate error code
- ‚úÖ Does not return any data

---

### Test 2: Organization Context Validation

**Objective:** Verify that all requests have organization context

**Steps:**
1. Login as a user
2. Get JWT token
3. Make API request with valid token
4. Verify organizationId is injected into request

**Test Code:**
```javascript
// Login first
const loginResponse = await fetch('http://localhost:3000/api/auth/login', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    email: 'user@hospital-a.com',
    password: 'password123'
  })
});

const { token } = await loginResponse.json();

// Try to access patients
const patientsResponse = await fetch('http://localhost:3000/api/patients', {
  headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}` }
});

console.log(await patientsResponse.json());
```

**Success Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ Request succeeds with valid token
- ‚úÖ Only returns patients from user's organization
- ‚úÖ Response does not include patients from other organizations

---

### Test 3: Cross-Organization Access Prevention

**Objective:** Verify users cannot access data from other organizations

**Setup:**
1. Create two organizations (Org A and Org B)
2. Create Patient 1 in Org A
3. Create Patient 2 in Org B
4. Create User 1 in Org A
5. Create User 2 in Org B

**Test Scenarios:**

#### Scenario A: List Patients
```bash
# User 1 (Org A) gets all patients
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/patients \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $USER1_TOKEN"
# Expected: Returns only Patient 1 (Org A)

# User 2 (Org B) gets all patients
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/patients \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $USER2_TOKEN"
# Expected: Returns only Patient 2 (Org B)
```

#### Scenario B: Get Specific Patient
```bash
# User 1 (Org A) tries to access Patient 2 (Org B)
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/patients/$PATIENT2_ID \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $USER1_TOKEN"
# Expected: 404 Not Found - "Patient not found or access denied"

# User 2 (Org B) tries to access Patient 1 (Org A)
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/patients/$PATIENT1_ID \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $USER2_TOKEN"
# Expected: 404 Not Found - "Patient not found or access denied"
```

#### Scenario C: Update Patient
```bash
# User 1 (Org A) tries to update Patient 2 (Org B)
curl -X PUT http://localhost:3000/api/patients/$PATIENT2_ID \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $USER1_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"firstName": "Hacked"}'
# Expected: 404 Not Found - Cannot update

# User 2 (Org B) tries to update Patient 1 (Org A)
curl -X PUT http://localhost:3000/api/patients/$PATIENT1_ID \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $USER2_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"firstName": "Hacked"}'
# Expected: 404 Not Found - Cannot update
```

#### Scenario D: Delete Patient
```bash
# User 1 (Org A) tries to delete Patient 2 (Org B)
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:3000/api/patients/$PATIENT2_ID \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $USER1_TOKEN"
# Expected: 404 Not Found - Cannot delete
```

**Success Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ Users can only see their own organization's data
- ‚úÖ Cross-org access returns 404 (not 403, to avoid info disclosure)
- ‚úÖ No data leakage in error messages
- ‚úÖ Audit log records access attempts

---

### Test 4: Statistics Isolation

**Objective:** Verify that statistics only include organization's data

**Test:**
```bash
# User 1 (Org A) gets patient statistics
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/patients/stats \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $USER1_TOKEN"
# Expected: Returns count for Org A only

# User 2 (Org B) gets patient statistics
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/patients/stats \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $USER2_TOKEN"
# Expected: Returns count for Org B only
```

**Verification:**
1. Manually count patients in each organization
2. Verify stats match the manual count
3. Verify total ‚â† sum of all organizations (each user sees only their org)

**Success Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ Each user sees only their organization's statistics
- ‚úÖ Numbers do not include other organizations' data
- ‚úÖ No information leakage through aggregates

---

### Test 5: Audit Logging

**Objective:** Verify security events are properly logged

**Test Procedure:**
1. Attempt cross-org access as User 1
2. Check audit logs for the event

```sql
-- Query audit logs
SELECT
  action,
  userId,
  organizationId,
  metadata,
  hipaaRelevant,
  createdAt
FROM audit_logs
WHERE
  action = 'CROSS_ORG_ACCESS_ATTEMPT'
ORDER BY createdAt DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

**Success Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ Event is logged in `audit_logs` table
- ‚úÖ `action` = 'CROSS_ORG_ACCESS_ATTEMPT'
- ‚úÖ `hipaaRelevant` = true
- ‚úÖ Includes userId, organizationId, IP address
- ‚úÖ Metadata contains attempted resource

---

### Test 6: Create Operations with organizationId

**Objective:** Verify new records are created with correct organizationId

**Test:**
```bash
# User 1 (Org A) creates a new patient
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/patients \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $USER1_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "firstName": "New",
    "lastName": "Patient",
    "email": "new.patient@example.com",
    "dateOfBirth": "1990-01-01"
  }'
# Expected: Patient created with organizationId = Org A
```

**Verification:**
```sql
-- Check the created patient
SELECT
  id,
  organizationId,
  firstName,
  lastName,
  email
FROM patients
WHERE email = 'new.patient@example.com';
```

**Success Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ Patient is created successfully
- ‚úÖ `organizationId` matches user's organization
- ‚úÖ Other users cannot see this patient

---

### Test 7: Related Data Isolation

**Objective:** Verify related data (observations, enrollments) is also isolated

**Setup:**
1. Create Observation 1 for Patient 1 (Org A)
2. Create Observation 2 for Patient 2 (Org B)

**Test:**
```bash
# User 1 (Org A) gets all observations
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/observations \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $USER1_TOKEN"
# Expected: Returns only observations for Org A patients

# User 2 (Org B) gets all observations
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/observations \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $USER2_TOKEN"
# Expected: Returns only observations for Org B patients
```

**Success Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ Observations are filtered by organizationId
- ‚úÖ Cannot access observations from other organizations
- ‚úÖ Related data maintains isolation

## üîç Database Verification Queries

### Verify Data Isolation

```sql
-- Check that all patients have organizationId
SELECT
  COUNT(*) as total_patients,
  COUNT(organizationId) as patients_with_org,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE organizationId IS NULL) as patients_without_org
FROM patients;
-- Expected: patients_without_org = 0

-- Check that all observations have organizationId
SELECT
  COUNT(*) as total_observations,
  COUNT(organizationId) as observations_with_org,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE organizationId IS NULL) as observations_without_org
FROM observations;
-- Expected: observations_without_org = 0

-- Check that all alerts have organizationId
SELECT
  COUNT(*) as total_alerts,
  COUNT(organizationId) as alerts_with_org,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE organizationId IS NULL) as alerts_without_org
FROM alerts;
-- Expected: alerts_without_org = 0
```

### Verify Organization Assignments

```sql
-- Count records per organization
SELECT
  o.name as organization_name,
  COUNT(DISTINCT p.id) as patients,
  COUNT(DISTINCT obs.id) as observations,
  COUNT(DISTINCT e.id) as enrollments
FROM organizations o
LEFT JOIN patients p ON p.organizationId = o.id
LEFT JOIN observations obs ON obs.organizationId = o.id
LEFT JOIN enrollments e ON e.organizationId = o.id
GROUP BY o.id, o.name
ORDER BY o.name;
```

### Check for Data Integrity Issues

```sql
-- Find patients without organization
SELECT * FROM patients WHERE organizationId IS NULL;
-- Expected: 0 rows

-- Find observations with mismatched organizationId
SELECT
  obs.id,
  obs.organizationId as obs_org,
  p.organizationId as patient_org
FROM observations obs
JOIN patients p ON obs.patientId = p.id
WHERE obs.organizationId != p.organizationId;
-- Expected: 0 rows

-- Find enrollments with mismatched organizationId
SELECT
  e.id,
  e.organizationId as enrollment_org,
  p.organizationId as patient_org
FROM enrollments e
JOIN patients p ON e.patientId = p.id
WHERE e.organizationId != p.organizationId;
-- Expected: 0 rows
```

## üö® Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "Organization context required" errors

**Symptom:** Users getting ORG_CONTEXT_MISSING errors

**Cause:** JWT token missing currentOrganization claim

**Solution:**
```javascript
// Ensure tokens include organization context
const token = await generateUserToken(user);
// This should include currentOrganization in the token payload
```

### Issue 2: Users seeing no data

**Symptom:** Users successfully authenticate but see empty result sets

**Cause:** User not assigned to an organization, or organizationId mismatch

**Solution:**
```sql
-- Check user's organization membership
SELECT * FROM user_organizations
WHERE userId = 'user-id-here';

-- Verify data exists in that organization
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM patients
WHERE organizationId = 'org-id-here';
```

### Issue 3: Audit logs not being created

**Symptom:** No entries in audit_logs table

**Cause:** Audit service not initialized or errors being swallowed

**Solution:**
1. Check audit service is properly imported
2. Verify database connection
3. Check for errors in logs
4. Test with manual audit log creation

---

## üìû Support & Escalation
